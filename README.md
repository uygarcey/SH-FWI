# Surfreq__SH
Surfreq_SH  is a  frequency domain 2-D SH wave  Full-waveform Inversion (FWI) package implemented in OCTAVE. 9-Point stencil finite difference is used for forward solution.Limited-memory BFGS approach is employed for inverse solution. A detailed description of the numerical methods used in in Surfreq will be uploaded
