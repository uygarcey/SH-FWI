# Surfreq__SH
Surfreq_SH  is a  frequency domain 2-D SH wave  Full-waveform Inversion (FWI) package implemented in OCTAVE.For forward solution, 9-Point stencil finite difference is used.For inverse solution,Limited-memory BFGS approach is employed. A detailed description of the numerical methods in Surfreq used will be uploaded
